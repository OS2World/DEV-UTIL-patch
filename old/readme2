This directory contains the 1990 version of `patch' which was on 
ftp-os2.nmsu.edu through August 1993. This version does not run in
tests on an OS/2 1.3 machine and on an OS/2 2.1 machine.

The sources for the 1990 version can be obtained by coping the files
in this directory to the directory containing the 1991 version, 
then apply patches2 in reverse.
